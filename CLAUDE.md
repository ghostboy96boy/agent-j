# Agent J: context for Claude Code

Open-source benchmark and guardrail library for AI agents that hold Lightning wallets. Target: OpenSats general grant (submission by end of November 2026).

Rules for work in this repo:
- Regtest only. Never add mainnet configuration, real keys or real funds.
- Never commit `.env` or credentials.
- The judge must score from settled payments on the network, never from the agent's own report.
- Findings in third-party tools follow SECURITY.md (private disclosure first).
- Keep docs in English; a Portuguese guide comes in phase 2.

Next task (phase 0): reference agent that pays regtest invoices through one stack, then the first 10 scenarios and the judge. See docs/ROADMAP.md.
